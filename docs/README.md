# Directory for GitHub Pages

This directory contains `index.md` to be rendered by GitHub Pages.  
It provides documentation for Protocol Buffers API definition located in `proto`.

To regenerate the documentation, run `./gen_proto_doc.sh`,  
then manually move additional settings table from `RecognitionConfig` description to below fields table (for better clarity).
